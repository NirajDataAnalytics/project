Objective of Weather Project in Metplotlib and Seaborn library in Python
1. To understand the relationship between the differents parameters which causes the weather changes
2.Weather happens due to these parameters that we can see at that particular time-
2.1 Apparent Temperature
2.2 Atmospheric Pressure
2.3 Wind Bearing and Wind Speed
2.4 Humidity
2.5 Precipitation- Snow, Rain
2.6 Cloudiness
3. Relate them all and observe the changes in weather and what impacts them to human, birds, animals

Conclusion and Summary

Summary

In the Year 2009, Highest Temperature- In which humidity and Temp is high Global Warming- Min and Max Temp Difference is approx. 130C
More Cloud- There is less power generation of Solar Power Plant, less visibility 
Variation in the wind bearing and speed of wind (km/h) ranges only between 5 to 20 km/h, it means for certain time period wind directions changes continuously this causes breezy in the winter season
Humidity ranges from 75% to 90% maximum, high humidity basically causes when temp is cool, Humidity is directly proportional to App. Temp.
When Temp is low wind speed is high and visibility is low
High Humidity also reduces the O2 level.
